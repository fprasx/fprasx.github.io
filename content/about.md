Hello!

<!-- more -->

I'm Felix, an MIT student studying CS.

My main interests lie around **performance engineering**, and other systems software
like **compilers** and data structure implementations. At its core, I want my work
to help other developers. I think these areas of CS dually satisfy that mission and my
intrinsic curiosity in a nice way.

This summer (2025), I'll be a software engineering intern at
[Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/). In past summers, I interned at:
* [JHU APL](https://www.jhuapl.edu/): hacking things.
* [Neon](https://neon.tech): creating on a networked component in the
  Autoscaling system that monitors VM's compute and memory usage.

Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/fprasx) to see some of the software
I've written. Two projects that I'm pretty proud of are:
* [cargo-unfmt](https://github.com/fprasx/cargo-unfmt) - an "unformatter" that
  formats Rust code into perfect rectangles. Made for an April Fool's joke where
  I fix ["inconsistencies" in `rustc`'s formatting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/123325).
* [peapod](https://github.com/fprasx/peapod) - a vector that stores enums
  compactly by storing tags and data separately

Feel free to reach out to me at _fpx at mit dot edu_.
