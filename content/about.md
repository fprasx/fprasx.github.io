Hello!

<!-- more -->

I'm Felix, an MIT student studying CS at MIT.

My main interests lie around **performance engineering**, and other system software
like **compilers** and data structure implementations. At its core, I want my work
to help other developers. I think these areas of CS dually satisfy that mission and my
intrinsic curiosity in a nice way.

Last summer (2023), I worked at [Neon](https://neon.tech) on a Rust-based
network component in the Autoscaling system. Basically, it allows Autoscaling to
respond to sudden load much much more snappily, as well as
generally simplfying the Autoscaling architecture; I think I deleted something
like 3,000 lines of code!

Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/fprasx) to see some of the software
I've written. Two projects that I'm pretty proud of are:
* [peapod](https://github.com/fprasx/peapod) - a vector that stores enums
  compactly by storing tags and data separately
* [unlocked](https://github.com/fprasx/unlocked) - a lock-free, thread-safe vector
  with an associated educational [mdbook](/concurrent-vector-book/index.html) on
  concurrency and Rust. My high school Senior Thesis which I used to learn Rust!

Feel free to reach out to me at _fpx at mit dot edu_.
