## A Message

Although I want you to come away from this book having learned something, and
hopefully feeling inspired to write more exciting code, this book is also a
learning experience for me.

I've never used Markdown before except for writing GitHub README's that only I'm
going to read, so simply using Mdbook is super exciting! I think Markdown is
cool because it's like HTML for lazy people (and I am **very** lazy).

Throughout the book, I will have many questions. I started teaching myself Rust
around ~half a year ago, so perhaps I'm not really qualified to write this book.
I'd never touched an atomic variable before I started this project (and I still
_technically_ haven't), so I really mean it when I say this is a learning
experience for me. I'll try to document the answers to the questions I have so
you can learn from them as well. There will also be a whole section of
reflections, as this is also for a school project. You might enjoy that section
more than the technical sections.

Before we get started, I want to clarify the structure of the book. There are
three main "sections": Theory/Algorithm, Code, and Reflections. Feel free to
bounce around if one section becomes too much.

And without further ado . . . `cargo run!`
